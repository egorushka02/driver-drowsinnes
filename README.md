This project was carried out as project on educational (familirization) practice. There are used 2 convolutional neural networks, which determine 2 factors: eye sticking and yawning. These neural networks are subsequently used to determine the level of slespness. The recognition of eyes in the image  is carried out using the OpenCV.
